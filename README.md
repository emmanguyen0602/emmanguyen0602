### About Me: 
I'm an bachelor at Thuongmai University. I have fallen in love with data science and machine learning since 2020 when I had to leave Hunan University to Vietnam due to pandemic. I had a difficult time because I didn't know where and how to start. On the path to data science, I gave up many times. And finally, I put 100% effort on it and live everyday with it. 
I completed several professional courses on Coursera:
- [IBM Data Analyst](https://coursera.org/share/12975e5c3ee2375aaaa49ab089ce9beb), 
- [IBM Data Science](https://coursera.org/share/c4484a97117b4996d3e62abee0f80d8e)
- [Create Machine Learning Models in Microsoft Azure](https://coursera.org/share/14a1170ca3ff7a4f7a8b5b787b8ffd3c). 

These courses helped me to build a foundation in data science theory and necessary workflow for a project. Later, I began to work on projects to deal with practical problems.
