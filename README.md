### Hi there, I'm Emma Nguyen - a self-taught data analyst/engineer! ðŸ‘‹

### About Me:
I'm a bachelor graduate from Thuongmai University with a strong passion for data science, data engineering and machine learning. Since 2020, when I had to leave Hunan University in Vietnam due to the pandemic, I've dedicated myself to self-learning in this field. Despite facing challenges along the way, I persevered and now live and breathe with data every day.

As an open-source enthusiast, I greatly value the open-source community, from which I've gained invaluable knowledge and experiences. I enjoy sharing my learnings through open-source projects.

I have completed several professional courses on Coursera, including IBM Data Analyst, IBM Data Science, and Create Machine Learning Models in Microsoft Azure. Feel free to check out my certificates on Coursera:
